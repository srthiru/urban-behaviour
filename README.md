# urban-behaviour (wip)

An extension of a group project (3 members) for the course - Big Data Visualizations. Please find the final report submitted here. I am working on implementing a fully functional version of the same using Streamlit.

Notable challenges in this project were the - large data size (millions of taxi ride and twitter records even for 3 months of data), and a compute heavy prediction model (used the huggingface zero-shot pipeline using the Roberta model for topic classification).

More details soon.
